**Cryptography**: Caesar Cipher

        The Roman General Julius Caesar used to correspond with his generals
        using a secret code. He devised a way of encrypting his messages using
        a simple encryption scheme now known as Caesar Cipher or Shift Cipher.
        You can read more about it here [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

        * You are given a class called CaesarCipher
        * with static methods encode and decode
        
        Being amateur codebreakers, 
        
        * we want to know if two distinct looking ciphers 
        * correspond to the same input message. 
        
        * Write a function called codeBreaker, 
        * which accepts two cipher strings 
        * and returns a boolean value which 
        * tells us whether they are actually the same input message encoded using two different offsets. 
        
        * There are multiple ways to do this.
        * Try to come up with as many solutions as you can.
